TO UPDATE/PUSH FILES: 

1. copy/delete/modify files inside of the github folder.

2. use the command "git add" to add those changes.
	ex. if I add a file "hi.txt" and a directory"images/" into 
	the git hub I would type:
		git add hi.txt
		git add images/

3. use the command "git commit -m "message/summary/title here" " to commit your changes.
	ex. for the above example I would simply type:
		git commit -m "added images and hi"

4. use the command "git push" to send the files to the repository.

tl;dr:
	1. copy file to git hub folder.
	2. git add file
	3. git commit -m "message/title/summary"
	4. git push


TO PULL/GET FILES:
	
1. use the command "git pull" to update your files with ones from the repository.
